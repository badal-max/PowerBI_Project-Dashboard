# PowerBI_Project-Dashboard
This is an end-to-end Power BI project designed to analyze store sales.

In this project, I incorporated data analysis techniques—specializing in time series analysis—to deliver valuable insights, accurate sales forecasting, and interactive dashboard creation, driving business success.

I performed data cleaning and processing, designed a dashboard using advanced charts, maps, filters, and slicers, and conducted data forecasting.
